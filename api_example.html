    <h1>Cat Artwork of the Art Institute of Chicago</h1>

    <div id="about">

        <p> I used the API from the Art Institue of Chicago's cat artwork. 
            I used this because I majored in art history in undergrad and I am interested in marging art and tech, so it is a useful thing to learn, 
        especially how to navigate images with iiif. <br> I found the website on the list of "actually free API's" that was in our class reading for this week. <br>
        In my query string, I searched for cats and I returned the fields for the artwork id, the title, the artist, and the date for 5 of them. <br>
        This API would be super helpful if I am ever doing writing about different artwork in various museums and I need to easily access many images in a catalog.
